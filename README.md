## Introduction üöÄ

This repository contains practical implementations of fundamental machine learning models. Whether you're building a predictive model, a classifier, or exploring regression techniques, these models can serve as a starting point for your machine learning journey.

## Models ü§ñ

### 1. K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- [Link to kNN Implementation](/knn.py)
- Description: kNN is a simple and effective algorithm for classification and regression, assigning labels based on the majority class or averaging the values of the k-nearest neighbors.

### 2. Linear Regression
- [Link to Linear Regression Implementation](/linear_regression.py)
- Description: Linear Regression is a classic model for predicting a continuous target variable based on input features, assuming a linear relationship between them.

### 3. Logistic Regression
- [Link to Logistic Regression Implementation](/logistic_regression.py)
- Description: Logistic Regression is a binary classification algorithm commonly used for predicting the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class.

### 4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- [Link to SVM Implementation](/svm_kernel.py)
- Description: SVM with kernel implementation for both classification and regression, providing a versatile approach for non-linear decision boundaries.

### 5. Lasso and Ridge Regression
- [Link to Lasso and Ridge Implementation](/lasso_ridge.py)
- Description: Lasso and Ridge Regression are regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting by adding penalty terms to the linear regression objective function.

## Usage 

To use these implementations, clone the repository and integrate the desired model into your project. Each implementation includes comments and documentation to help you understand and adapt the code for your specific use case.
